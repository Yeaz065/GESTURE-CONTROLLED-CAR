# GESTURE-CONTROLLED-CAR

This project aims to find out if hand gestures can reasonably be used to control the movement of a robot or car. This is an easy, user-friendly way to interact with robotic systems and robots. There are two main components of the system: The accelerometer depends upon the gestures of the hand. Through the accelerometer, a passage of data signal is received and it is processed with the help of Arduino microcontroller. The microcontroller gives the command to the robot to move in the desired direction.
